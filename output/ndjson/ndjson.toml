[[output.ndjson]]
  ## Destination URL to send ndjson encoded data to
  # This should be an endpoint that accepts HTTP POST requests with a body
  # containing newline-delimited JSON objects.
  # if empty, will print to stdout
  ## Example:
  # e.g. "http://127.0.0.1:5654/db/write/TAG"
  dest = ""

  ## Time format to use for the "time" field in the output JSON objects
  ## See https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time.Format for details on the format
  # e.g.
  # "s" for seconds since epoch
  # "ms" for milliseconds since epoch
  # "us" for microseconds since epoch
  # "ns" for nanoseconds since epoch
  # "2006-01-02 15:04:05" for a common datetime format
  # "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00" for RFC3339 format
  timeformat = "2006-01-02 15:04:05"

  ## For odometer type metrics, how to select the value to report
  # "diff" for difference since last value
  # "no_negative_diff" for no negative difference, if the difference is negative, report 0
  # "abs_diff" for absolute difference, useful for values that may wrap around
  odometer_value_selector = "diff"

  ## For histogram type metrics, which percentile value to report
  # e.g. 
  # 0.95 for 95th percentile
  # 0.5 for median (default)
  histogram_value_selector = 0.5
